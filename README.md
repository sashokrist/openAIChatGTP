## üìÅ Project Structure & Workflow

**Backend (Laravel):**
- `routes/web.php` ‚Äì Defines the route to serve the chat interface
- `routes/api.php` ‚Äì Defines API endpoint for chat messages
- `app/Http/Controllers/ChatController.php` ‚Äì Handles input/output to/from OpenAI
- `app/Models/Message.php` ‚Äì Eloquent model for storing messages
- `resources/views/chat.blade.php` ‚Äì Chat UI built with Blade and JavaScript
- `.env` ‚Äì Stores credentials including `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Frontend:**
- Chat form submits message via AJAX to the Laravel API
- Message is saved to database and sent to OpenAI
- API responds with ChatGPT reply, which is stored and displayed in UI

**Workflow Overview:**
1. User enters message into the chat input
2. JavaScript sends it to the Laravel API (`/api/chat`)
3. Controller sends request to OpenAI using Guzzle HTTP client
4. OpenAI response is saved to DB and returned as JSON
5. JavaScript appends the response to the chat window
